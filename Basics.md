 ### Javascript Where To
* In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
* Scripts can  be placed in an HTML document. Javascript can be placed in the `<body>`, or in the `<head>` section of an HTML page, or in both.
* Scripts can also be placed in external files
   * External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.
   * JavaScript files have the file extension .js
   * To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:
      ```html
     <script src="myScript.js"></script>
      ```
      You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.
     ##### External JavaScript Advantages 
     * It separates HTML and code
     * It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
     * Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

 ### Javascript Comments  
 JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and also used to prevent execution.                   
 Single Line Comments  start with `//`.                                        
 Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
