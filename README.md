### 1. Define var,let, const
var ,let.const are used for function declaration in javascript\
**var** - var variables are function-scoped because their visibility is limited to the function.\
**let** - let are block-scoped because their visibility is limited  inside curly brace.\
**const** - const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned.The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.


### 2.What is the difference between == and ===?
Both are comparison operators. The difference between both the operators is that,“==” is used to compare values whereas, “ === “ is used to compare both value and types.

### 3.What are undeclared and undefined variables?

   **Undeclared variables** are those that do not exist in a program and are not declared. If the program tries to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered.

   **Undefined variables** are those that are declared in the program but have not been given any value. If the program tries to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.
   
### What is Callback Functions? 
   A callback is a function that will be executed after another function gets executed.\
   Functions that are used as an argument to another function are called callback functions.
   
 ```javascript
function multiplyBy2(sum){
   console.log(sum * 2);
}

function operationOnSum(num1,num2,operation){
  var sum = num1 + num2;
  operation(sum);
}

 operationOnSum(3, 3, divideByHalf); // Outputs 3
 ```
        



   
###  Explain Hoisting in javascript?
   Hoisting is a default behaviour of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top.
